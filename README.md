Based on your project brief, here is a detailed breakdown of the front-end architecture and the complete UI flow to guide your development. This structure is designed for a fast, intuitive experience that aligns perfectly with your team's workflow.

### Front-End Architecture

Our front-end will be built using a **component-driven architecture**, which is the most effective pattern for Vue.js. This approach allows us to build the UI from small, reusable pieces and assemble them into pages.

* **Component Hierarchy:** We will follow a pattern similar to Atomic Design to organize our components.
    * **Atoms:** The smallest, most fundamental UI elements. (e.g., `BaseButton.vue`, `BaseInput.vue`, `BaseIcon.vue`).
    * **Molecules:** Groups of atoms working together. (e.g., `BookingForm.vue`, `Navbar.vue`, `Footer.vue`).
    * **Organisms:** Complex sections of the UI, composed of molecules and atoms. (e.g., `HeroSection.vue`, `ServiceCardSection.vue`).
    * **Templates/Pages:** The final layouts, where we assemble organisms to create a full page. (e.g., `HomePage.vue`, `BookPickupPage.vue`).

* **State Management (Pinia):** We will use **Pinia** as the single source of truth for all application data. The booking form data, user details, and order status will be managed in Pinia stores. This avoids passing props through many components and keeps data synchronized across the app.

* **API Integration:** The front-end will communicate with your colleague's back-end via a **RESTful API**. Components will fetch and submit data using a library like **Axios**. The front-end will only focus on displaying the UI and handling user input.

* **Routing (Vue Router):** **Vue Router** will handle all navigation. We will set up distinct routes for public pages (Home, Services), user pages (`/profile`, `/dashboard`), and the booking process.

* **Styling (Tailwind CSS):** All styling will be handled with **Tailwind's utility-first approach**, using our custom colors and fonts. This keeps styles local to the component, making development fast and consistent.

### UI Flow Breakdown (The User Journey)

The entire UI flow is centered around a fast, clear, and trustworthy user experience.

#### 1. Discovery & Information Flow

This flow covers a new visitor's first interaction with the site. The goal is to inform them and build trust.

* **Home Page:**
    * **Hero Section:** A clear headline and a prominent "Book Pickup" button. .
    * **Services & Pricing Highlights:** Quick previews to show what we do and our pricing.
    * **How it works:** A simple 3-step graphic (Book, Pickup, Delivery).
    * **Reviews:** A slider or grid of positive customer reviews.
    * **CTAs:** Multiple "Book Pickup" buttons placed throughout the page.

* **Services Page:**
    * A single, clean page that lists all services (e.g., Wash & Fold, Dry Cleaning, Native Wear).

* **Pricing Page:**
    * A clean table or card layout with `service name`, `price`, and `normal turnaround time`.
    * Clearly show prices for `add-ons` like `Express` and `Stain Care`.
    * List `delivery fees by zone` and the `free delivery threshold`.

* **How it works Page:**
    * A simple, visually-driven page explaining the booking-to-delivery process.

#### 2. Booking a Pickup Flow

This is the most critical flow and must be very fast. It will likely be a multi-step form.

* **Step 1: Service and Details**
    * User enters `service type` (radio buttons).
    * User enters `estimated number of items`.
    * User selects `add-ons`.
    * User enters `special care notes` and takes a `photo` (using a simple file input for the staff to see later).
    * User enters a `coupon code` and the new total is shown.
    * `Next` button.

* **Step 2: Time and Address**
    * User enters `Full name` and `phone number`. (The `phone number` field can also trigger a sign-in check for returning customers).
    * User enters `address` and `nearest landmark`.
    * User chooses `pickup time window` and `delivery time window` from a set of predefined options.
    * The total is updated with the correct `delivery fee`.
    * `Next` button.

* **Step 3: Confirmation**
    * A summary page showing all entered details.
    * `Final "Book Pickup"` button.
    * Option to save details for future use.

#### 3. Post-Booking & Order Management Flow

This flow focuses on keeping the customer informed and in control.

* **Success Page:**
    * A full-screen success message with the order number.
    * Prominent `View Order Status` button.

* **Order Status Page:**
    * Displays the `order number` and `status tracker`.
    * Shows the `Booked → Picked Up → In Cleaning → Ready → Out for Delivery → Delivered` steps with the current one highlighted.
    * Includes `Reschedule` and `Cancel` links.
    * Displays `pickup notes` and `photos` from the staff.

#### 4. Account & Membership Flow

* **Sign In:**
    * A simple form with a `phone number` field.
    * Pressing `Login` sends a one-time code to the number.
    * A new field appears to enter the code.
    * The user is then signed in.

* **Account Page:**
    * Simple page to view and edit `saved addresses` and `garment preferences`.
    * `Referral code` is displayed here.
    * `Join Membership` button visible for non-members.

#### 5. Support & Communication Flow

* `Chat on WhatsApp` button on every page links to our WhatsApp number.
* `Issue Form`: A simple form with `name`, `phone`, `order number`, and a `message field`.
* `Care Promise Page`: A static page that explains our policy for handling issues.

This comprehensive UI flow ensures that every feature in the brief is handled, providing a clear path for development.
